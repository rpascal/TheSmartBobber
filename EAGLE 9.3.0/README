-- Wingows Graphics Driver Issues
Intel HD Graphics 4000, Intel HD Graphics 530 and few others graphics cards are knows to cause WebGL errors.
EAGLE uses WebGL for the package generator available in the library and device editors.
There are two workarounds:
1) In some cases disabling framebuffer multisampling could help workaround the issue and keep using hardware OpenGL:
  cd "c:\EAGLE x.x.x" 
  set QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS=–disable_chromium_framebuffer_multisample
  eagle.exe
2) If (1) doesn't work use software OpenGL mode by running eagle_SW_OpenGL.bat script instead of eagle.exe

-- Various WebEngine errors
EAGLE passes '--ignore-gpu-blacklist' to Chromium by default.
This enables WebGL even on graphics cards / drivers that are known to have problems with it.
If you encounter issues with HTML content including bugs in WebGL then set QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS environment variable to “--ignore-gpu-blacklist=false” and run EAGLE:
  cd "c:\EAGLE x.x.x" 
  set QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS=--ignore-gpu-blacklist=false
  eagle.exe

-- Crash on start caused by Dell Backup and Recovery --
Dell Backup and Recovery is incompatible with EAGLE.
It causes EAGLE to crash on start.
Dell Backup and Recovery can be uninstalled or its shell extension disabled.
